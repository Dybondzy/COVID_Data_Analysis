---------------------------------------------
1.	We input/imported data from the following tables into PGAdmin
cdc_db_cleaned_part1 (into CDC_INPUTDB_CLEANED),
cdc_db_cleaned_part2 (into CDC_INPUTDB_CLEANED),
cdc_db_cleaned_part3 (into CDC_INPUTDB_CLEANED),
cdc_db_cleaned_part4 (into CDC_INPUTDB_CLEANED),
household_income_by_state (into ST_INCOME),
state_factors_from_gallup (into US_POLITICS),
census_sex_no_covid (into CENSUS_SEX),
census_age_no_covid (into CENSUS_RACE)	


2.	We created the following tables in PGAdmin, from CDC_INPUTDB_CLEANED:
DATA_AGE_GROUP (We identified the age group options:
age_group_0_17, age_group_18_49, age_group_50_64, age_group_65PLUS),

US_STATES(We identified the states, dropping DC),

DATA_SEX(We identified the sex options: MALE, FEMALE),

DATA_RACE (We identified the race options:
Asian, Black, Multiple/Other, White,
American Indian/Alaska Native,
Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander,
NO_IDENTIFIED_RACE)



3.	Using the table: US_STATES, we created COVID totals, of totals per state, from the table:CDC_INPUTDB_CLEANED

------------------------
1ST calculated the totals for the age group
INSERT INTO AGE_GROUP
(
SELECT DISTINCT RES_STATE ST,AGE_GROUP, COUNT(DATA_ID) TOTAL_AGE
FROM CDC_INPUTDB_CLEANED
GROUP BY RES_STATE, AGE_GROUP
)
------------------------
Calculated the sex totals

INSERT INTO SEX_GROUP
(
SELECT DISTINCT RES_STATE ST, SEX, COUNT(DATA_ID) TOTAL_SEX
FROM CDC_INPUTDB_CLEANED
GROUP BY RES_STATE, SEX
)


------------------------
Calculated the race totals

INSERT INTO RACE_GROUP
(
SELECT DISTINCT RES_STATE ST,RACE,COUNT(DATA_ID) TOTAL_RACE
FROM CDC_INPUTDB_CLEANED
GROUP BY RES_STATE, RACE
)
------------------------


4.	Using the table: US_STATES, and the calculated COVID totals, 
and created the table: COVID_MARCH2020_DEC2020_TOTALS
(limited function of the SQL process due to limit of my personal laptop)
-----------------------

INSERT INTO COVID_MARCH2020_DEC2020_TOTALS

5.	Using the table: US_STATES, we added all the tables with totals,

-----------------------

6.	We calculated:

I.	Total_STATE_population = CENSUS_Population 
II.	Total_STATE_population_SQMILE = Total_STATE_population/STATE_LAND_AREA_SQMILE
III.	Total_COVID_ST_population = COVID_sex_FEMALE + COVID_sex_MALE
IV.	Total_COVID_ST_population_SQMILE = Total_COVID_ST_population/STATE_LAND_AREA_SQMILE
V.	Total_NOCOVID_ST_population = sex_female_no_covid + sex_male_no_covid
VI.	Total_NOCOVID_ST_population_SQMILE=Total_NOCOVID_ST_population/STATE_LAND_AREA_SQMILE
VII.	TARGET_VAR_COVID_per_STATE = (total_COVID_ST_population / total_STATE_population)
VIII.	
IX.	POPULATION_DENSITY = total_STATE_population/STATE_LAND_AREA (eg. Alabama has a population of 4,903,185 
	and a land area of 570,641 so the population density should be 8.56)
X.	We calculated the Total Ration of every column except 
	-	total_COVID_ST_population (because we already have this as our target), 
	-	total_STATE_population,
 	-	state_policy_prevention_mandates_score, 
	-	economic_confidence_index, 
	-	tot_airports, 
	-	state_land_area_sqmile, 
	-	airport_area,

7.	We exported our table COVID_MARCH2020_DEC2020_TOTALS_PROJECT4 from PGAdmin to the csv file:

8.	In Excel, after the export, we had to do the following, to make the data even more representative

a.	remove DC data because it had too many nill values
b.	change the few other nill values to zero

Reason for change in Deliverable 4

The facts are simply this:
Our aggregated table does not have a lot of predictive power. What a machine learning does is split data into testing and predictive so it will take 75% of our data and try to predict the other 25%. That means that it will take 35 states, learn from those states, and then use that to predict the affect of covid for the other 15. That is not good analysis. These states are individual observations. To have the model take CA and NY and predict for Nebraska would be bad.
With data aggregated by state, we simply cannot find the factors for each state and compare with the big table, even if running our big table through the ML model had any sort of sound analysis. That was what triggered the conversation with Zeb in the first place.
This leaves us with faulty analysis and a bad ML model. So what's the alternative?
The alternative is we try something else, mainly because we don't have much of a choice. This doesn't mean what we did was worthless. It's still an excellent tool for Tableau and data visualizations, plus everything that David laid out in his earlier message, and it was a big help in what I'm about to explain next.
Our only alternative is to go back to what we originally wanted to do in the first place - be able to predict whether or not someone has covid based on a bunch of factors with the target variable being whether or not a person has covid. That was the original idea. Where it snagged was that we only had data for who has covid and no data for who does not have covid. David and I have been working on a way to use feature engineering (Zeb said it was incorrect to say synthetic data) to create new values for those people who do not have covid. We used the big table Dinah created in SQL to help us do this. It's already almost done. Once I send those tables to you Dinah, we could have a ML model for this as soon as tomorrow. We'll be able to run ML models for this big new table and ML models for each state and compare. That's the current plan which we laid out in our post Zeb meeting which I thought we were mostly on board for.
There is not much being done outside the scope of this bootcamp. The creating the "synthetic data" kind of is but again, it's already almost done, and even then, we have done feature engineering in this bootcamp, it's not necessarily new
